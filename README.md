# lmu-synch
These scripts fetch the video names and URLs from an LMU-Cast website (for the courses "Generalized Regression" and "Statistical Inference" respectively), generates corresponding filenames and downloads the videos to the directory which contains this script (unless these filenames already exist in there). For this you require the python packages listed in the respective scripts. Also, you need to fill in your own uni email and password below before running the script.

Feel free to modify the scripts for other lectures hosted on the same websites.
