# lmu-synch
This script fetches the video names and URLs from an LMU-Cast website, generates corresponding filenames and downloads the videos to the directory which contains this script (unless these filenames already exist in there). For this you require the listed python packages. Also, you need to specify the LMU-cast URL, fill in your own uni email and password below before running the script.
